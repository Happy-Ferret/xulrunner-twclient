xulrunner-twclient
==================

A #thaiWitter client developed on __XULRunner 13.0.2__.

It is basically a site-specific browser for [#thaiWitter web application](https://tw3.herokuapp.com/)
with few APIs added to the window, such as notification, link opening, cross-domain XHR, and userstreaming.

It also has a script to build a packaged application for Mac OS X and <del>Windows</del> (coming soon)
and <del>Linux</del> (maybe).

Part of this code is adapted from [Mozilla Prism](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Prism/).


Fork Me!
--------

Currently this code is coupled to #thaiWitter web app, but it can be a starting point
for other people who wants to make a site-specific browser like this one.

__Even better__ if someone fork this and make it a general-purpose site-specific browser,
with the ability to set the starting URL, application name, and other stuff based on some
kind of a configuration file.
